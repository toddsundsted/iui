Usage

   This version of iUI includes the following extensions:

 * Form and link based page reloading.  Use the attribute
   "target='_self'" or "target='_webapp'" on form elements and links
   to instruct iUI to load the contents into a new page.

 * AJAX-style surgery on the DOM. Use the attribute "target='foo'" on
   form elements and links to instruct iUI to replace the element with
   that id with the contents.

 * Added hooks for before and after a page slide.  Use the attributes
   "beforeload" and "afterload" to include javascript to execute.
